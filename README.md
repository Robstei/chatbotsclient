## Usage
This package consists of a <code>Moderator</code> and a <code>Chatbot</code> class to make chatbots talk to each other. It is required to have a moderator instance up running before chatbots try to connect to the conversation. Messages are sent through websocket channels using [pusher](https://pusher.com/). The moderator collects all messages from connected chatbots and selects the best fit. 

### Moderator
#### Setup
Simply instantiate a <code>Moderator</code> object. The moderator will wait for chatbots to connect and provides the possiblity to start the conversation by input.
The chatting-chatbots repository already consists of a moderator script: <code>chatting-chatbots/moderator/moderator.py</code>.
```python
# chatting-chatbots/moderator/moderator.py
from chatbotsclient.moderator import Moderator

moderator = Moderator()
```

Before connecting your chatbot to the conversation wait for the moderator to prompt <code>"Message: "</code>. Otherwise the connection might not be established successfully. Once chatbots are connected, the conversation may be initialized by inputing a string.

While the conversation is ongoing the moderator script will prompt message scores. Chatbots will only respond to messages of other chatbots.

#### Moderator Panel
When passing <code>connect_panel=True</code> panel mode is activated. The moderator panel is located in the chatting-chatbots repository (moderator/panel).

```python
# chatting-chatbots/moderator/moderator.py
from chatbotsclient.moderator import Moderator

moderator = Moderator(connect_panel=True)
```

### Chatbot
#### Basic Setup
Instantiate a <code>Chatbot</code> object and pass your custom respond function. When ever a message from the moderator is received the provided respond method will be executed. The moderator script must run in first place.
```python
from chatbotsclient.chatbot import Chatbot
from chatbotsclient.message import Message
from typing import List

def compute(message, conversation):
    # custom answer computation of your chatbot
    ...
    
def respond(message: Message, conversation: List[Message]):
    answer = compute(message.message, conversation)
    return answer

chatbot = Chatbot(respond, "<chatbot_name>")
```
The <code>compute</code> method is meant as a placeholder for your specific method to return an answer for the provided message. Thus the method is not part of *chatbotsclient* package.

You may also ignore the conversation list:
```python
def compute(message, conversation):
    # custom answer computation of your chatbot ignoring the conversation list
    ...
    
def respond(message: Message, conversation: List[Message]):
    answer = compute(message.message)
    return answer
```

## Features
### Message Object
A <code>Message</code> object is passed to the custom respond function of your bot. It contains the plain text message as well as information about the sending bot.
|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|message|Plain text message. Used to compute your chatbots answer.|
|bot_id|Id of the sending bot.|
|bot_name|Name of the sending bot. Could be used for entity replacement.|

### Conversation List
List containing all previously selected messages.

### Ranking scores
The moderator ranks all incoming message by following criteria:
|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|Similarity|To fit the previous message, but also to prevent looping conversations|
|Conversation share|To ensure a varied conversation|
|Topic|Subject fitting|
